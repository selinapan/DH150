# Venmo
## Selina Pan
### Intro
This project is about finding an easier way to handle finances, transactions, and budgeting easier. As a college student, I am interested in saving money, quickly paying my friends back or being paid back, and seeing how much money I have left to spend that day, week, month, or year. This application allows for all of these tasks to happen in one place rather than multiple apps or spreadsheet, making it easy to keep track of everything. The functions of this application cater to anyone looking for a simple way to record finances and transact money.

### Design Statement
Currently, Venmo is a smartphone application that allows people to transact money. Thus, as long as people have money in their account, people can go out without any cash or coins. There are many advantages to Venmo, such as paying or requesting someone exact cents and transfer money in or out of their bank account to their Venmo account, but there are some functions missing that would make the application more useful and efficient. For example, there is no way to see a sum of what you've paid versus requested, every transaction is its own separate entity. Additionally, it would be helpful to be able to record a picture of a receipt, rather than having a stack of receipts somewhere in a drawer. Finally, there should be a way that allows a user to charge the same amount to multiple people at once, rather than tediously repeating a pay or request to five people. The social aspect of Venmo seems to take away from the purpose of the application, so making the home screen centered on the user would be beneficial to helping the user see their finances. Rearranging some of the features to better serve user's needs and adding these functions would increase the usability and efficiency of Venmo.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
I chose to focus my project on the finance and banking community, because Venmo and Wescom are apps that I personally use a lot. These applications are useful to anyone with a bank account, probably high schoolers and older.  I aim to recognize, detect, and analyze both applications following Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems.

### Competitor analysis: Usability testing
I conducted a usability test to measure the usability of Venmo and to observe a user perform real tasks that the app is meant for. I wanted to understand a user's thought process when attempting different tasks and to measure the easiness and efficiency of Venmo. Specifically, I wanted to hear the thought process of another user when navigating Venmo to check basic information, calculate the bill on Venmo, and try to pay multiple people at once.

During this process, I learned some complications that a real user of Venmo experiences and what she would like to see to improve these issues. My participant was unable to charge the same amount to multiple people at once and expressed how it would be more efficient and convenient if Venmo were to have this function. Some basic features are not as noticeables as they should be. For example, there are basic calculator functions on Venmo, but often times users overlook the buttons and open a separate calculator app. She expressed how she liked the current app, but would like to see improvement.

### User research [contextual inquiry]:
This project will support user's financial needs, such as handling  budgeting and transactions. Current solutions satisfy basic transactions, but can be remade to be more efficient and expand to fit other uses. The features I want to add stem from my own use by myself and with friends. For this task, I interviewed a college student to better understand her needs and expectations from the app, so that I could evaluate what needed to be changed.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario]
The personas and scenarios were created to visualize what types of users would be using this application and what needs they would want satisfied. Thus, I created a Powerpoint slide of three hypothetical users, consisting of their demographics, needs and wants, and possible common situtations they might find themselves in.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation:
First, I sketched five main wireframes on paper. These represented the five main screens I envisioned my application to have. When creating these, I kept in mind the three tasks that I wanted my application to accomplish - recording a receipt, paying or requesting multiple people at once, and seeing transaction history.

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow)
Next, I sketched how these wireframes would interact to be able to do the three tasks, creating a wireflow on paper. These showed the possible interactions with the application, and later I had a user test the low-fidelity prototype.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype)
Finally, I used Adobe XD to bring the paper sketches to a digital, interactive prototype. I first had to learn how to navigate Adobe XD in order to create frames in the shape of an iPhone XR and download Adobe XD iOS ui kits to add parts that made the wireframes look more realistic. I also used the Noun Project in order to download and use icons that were simple and recognizable, like a search icon and settings icon. Then, I started to create the wireframes I had sketched on paper, and added more that I needed to run my three tasks. After I was satisfied with how my wireframes looked, I used Adobe XD's prototype function to link buttons to slides and create my wireflow. After everything I wanted was linked, I had a tester try the three tasks I set and discovered a dead end on one frame, which I later fixed.

### Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?
I learned that there's a lot more that goes into the creation of applications and websites than I had previously thought. The process of deciding what's best for your users can be hard, as not all users value the same things. Deciding what to input and why was one of the greatest challenges, because I wanted to change Venmo based on my own experience as a user. However, not all users may have had the same experience and would prefer to keep the app as is. Learning how to implement useful functions and actually design a prototype was interesting and exciting, and I now better understand the time and effort UI/UX designers put into creating new products. I enjoyed my time in this class and now have experience in coding in html, GitHub markdown syntax, the design process, and Adobe XD.
